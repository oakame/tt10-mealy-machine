## How it works

A Mealy machine is a type of finite state machine where the output is
determined by both the current state and the current input.

## How to test

A Mealy machine works by producing outputs that depend on both the
current state and the current input. To check if it's working
correctly, you need to verify that its outputs change according to this
principle when different inputs are applied while the machine is in
different states. This can be done by observing the state transitions
and corresponding outputs based on a state diagram or transition table.
